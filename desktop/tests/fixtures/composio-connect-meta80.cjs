Always creates a new auth link. Enforces max account limit.\n- \"rename\": Rename the alias on an existing account. Requires account_id and alias.\n- \"list\": List all connected accounts for a toolkit. Returns account IDs, aliases, and statuses. No side effects.\n- \"remove\": Remove/delete a connected account. Requires account_id.\n\nWorkflow after initiating connection:\n- Always show the returned redirect_url as a FORMATTED MARKDOWN LINK in your final response for this turn as intermediate messages may be hidden or summarized by the chat interface, so the user may not see the link there. Ask the user to click on the link to finish authentication and reply when done.\n- After the user replies, call COMPOSIO_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS with action=\"list\" and check that the newly added account is active before continuing.\n- Begin executing tools only after the connection is confirmed Active.\n\nConnections are private to the user; a Team connection shares an app account with the user's teammates and is created at https://dashboard.composio.dev/~/org/connect/apps/<toolkit slug>?source=mcp.",

    "description": "\n  Fast and parallel tool executor for tools discovered through COMPOSIO_SEARCH_TOOLS. Use this tool to execute up to 50 tools in parallel across apps only when they're logically independent (no ordering/output dependencies). Response contains structured outputs ready for immediate analysis - avoid reprocessing them via remote bash/workbench tools.\n\nPrerequisites:\n- Always use valid tool slugs and their arguments. NEVER invent tool slugs or argument fields. ALWAYS pass STRICTLY schema-compliant arguments with each tool execution.\n- Ensure an ACTIVE connection exists for the toolkits that are going to be executed. If none exists, MUST initiate one via COMPOSIO_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS before execution.\n- Only batch tools that are logically independent - no ordering, no output-to-input dependencies, and no intra-call chaining (tools in one call can't use each other's outputs). DO NOT pass dummy or placeholder inputs; always resolve required inputs using appropriate tools first.\n\nUsage guidelines:\n- If COMPOSIO_SEARCH_TOOLS returns a tool that can perform the task, prefer calling it via this executor. Do not write custom API calls or ad-hoc scripts for tasks that can be completed by available Composio tools.\n- Prefer parallel execution: group independent tools into a single multi-execute call where possible.\n- Predictively set sync_response_to_workbench=true if the response may be large or needed for later scripting. It still shows response inline; if the actual response data turns out small and easy to handle, keep everything inline and SKIP workbench usage.\n- Responses contain structured outputs for each tool. RULE: Small data - process yourself inline; large data - process in the workbench.\n- ALWAYS include inline references/links to sources in MARKDOWN format directly next to the relevant text. Eg provide slack thread links alongside with summary, render document links instead of raw IDs.\n\nRestrictions: Some tools or toolkits may be disabled in this environment. If the response indicates a restriction, inform the user and STOP execution immediately. Do NOT attempt workarounds or speculative actions.\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n  Tool Server Info: Composio connects 500+ apps—Slack, GitHub, Notion, Google Workspace (Gmail, Sheets, Drive, Calendar), Microsoft (Outlook, Teams), X/Twitter, Figma, Web Search / Deep research, Browser tool (scrape URLs, browser automation), Meta apps (Instagram, Meta Ads), TikTok, and more—for seamless cross-app automation.\n  Use this tool to discover relevant tools plus the recommended plan and common pitfalls for reliable execution.\n  Always call this tool first whenever a user mentions or implies an external app, service, or workflow—never say \"I don't have access to X/Y app\" before calling it.\n\nUsage guidelines:\n  - Use this tool whenever kicking off a task. Re-run it when you need additional tools/plans due to missing details, errors, or a changed use case.\n  - Use search_strategy: \"auto\" normally. If the returned plan does not match the current request or an expected tool is missing, retry the same queries with search_strategy: \"tool_search\" to bypass cached plans and run direct tool search.\n  - If the user pivots to a different use case in same chat, you MUST call this tool again with the new use case and generate a new session_id.\n  - Specify the use_case with a normalized description of the problem, query, or task. Be clear and precise. Queries can be simple single-app actions or multiple linked queries for complex cross-app workflows.\n  - Pass known_fields along with use_case as a string of key–value hints (for example, \"channel_name: general\") to help the search resolve missing details such as IDs.\n  \n\nSplitting guidelines (Important):\n  1. Atomic queries: 1 query = 1 tool call. Include hidden prerequisites (e.g., add \"get Linear issue\" before \"update Linear issue\").\n  2. Include app names: If user names a toolkit, include it in every sub query so intent stays scoped (e.g., \"fetch Gmail emails\", \"reply to Gmail email\").\n  3. English input: Translate non-English prompts while preserving intent and identifiers.\n\n  Example:\n  User query: \"send an email to John welcoming him and create a meeting invite for tomorrow\"\n  Search call: queries: [\n    {use_case: \"send an email to someone\", known_fields: \"recipient_name: John\"},\n    {use_case: \"create a meeting invite\", known_fields: \"meeting_date: tomorrow\"}\n  ]\n\nPlan review checklist (Important):\n  - The response includes a detailed execution plan and common pitfalls. You MUST review this plan carefully, adapt it to your current context, and generate your own final step-by-step plan before execution. Execute the steps in order to ensure reliable and accurate execution. Skipping or ignoring required steps can lead to unexpected failures.\n  - Check the plan and pitfalls for input parameter nuances (required fields, IDs, formats, limits). Before executing any tool, you MUST review its COMPLETE input schema and provide STRICTLY schema-compliant arguments to avoid invalid-input errors.\n  - Determine whether pagination is needed; if a response returns a pagination token and completeness is implied, paginate until exhaustion and do not return partial results.\n\nResponse:\n  - Tools & Input Schemas: The response lists toolkits (apps) and tools suitable for the task, along with their tool_slug, description, input schema / schemaRef, and related tools for prerequisites, alternatives, or next steps.\n    - NOTE: Tools with schemaRef instead of input_schema require you to call COMPOSIO_GET_TOOL_SCHEMAS first to load their full input_schema before use.\n  - Connection Info: If a toolkit has an active connection, the response includes it along with any available current user information. If no active connection exists, you MUST initiate a new connection via COMPOSIO_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS with the correct toolkit name. DO NOT execute any toolkit tool without an ACTIVE connection.\n  - Time Info: The response includes the current UTC time for reference. You can reference UTC time from the response if needed.\n  \n  - The tools returned to you through this are to be called via COMPOSIO_MULTI_EXECUTE_TOOL. Ensure each tool execution specifies the correct tool_slug and arguments exactly as defined by the tool's input schema.\n  \nSESSION: ALWAYS set this parameter, first for any workflow. Pass session: {generate_id: true} for new workflows OR session: {id: \"EXISTING_ID\"} to continue. ALWAYS use the returned session_id in ALL subsequent meta tool calls.\n\nApps outside the Composio catalog can be added by the user as a custom MCP server (any HTTP or SSE endpoint) at https://dashboard.composio.dev/~/org/connect/apps?add-custom-mcp=true.",
