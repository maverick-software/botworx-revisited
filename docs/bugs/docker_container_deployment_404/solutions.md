## 🔧 Solution 2: Add Database-Backed Container Registry (ROBUST FIX)
**Priority:** HIGH - Long-term solution  
**Complexity:** MEDIUM  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  

### Description
Implement a database-backed container registry that syncs DTMA container state with the Agentopia database, eliminating in-memory tracking issues.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Design database schema** for container state management
2. **Create DTMA-Database sync service** 
3. **Implement container state persistence** in DTMA
4. **Add state reconciliation logic** for recovery scenarios
5. **Update deployment and lifecycle operations** to use database

### Database Schema Design
```sql
CREATE TABLE dtma_container_registry (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  account_tool_instance_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES account_tool_instances(id),
  container_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  docker_image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  container_id VARCHAR(64),
  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  port_bindings JSONB,
  environment_variables JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(account_tool_instance_id, container_name)
);
```

### Pros
✅ **Persistent state** - Survives DTMA restarts  
✅ **Scalable solution** - Database-backed tracking  
✅ **State synchronization** - Agentopia and DTMA stay in sync

### Cons
❌ **Development complexity** - Requires significant coding  
❌ **Database dependencies** - Additional infrastructure complexity  
❌ **Migration effort** - Need to migrate existing containers  
❌ **Testing requirements** - Extensive testing needed  

### Feasibility Assessment
**Technical:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High)  
**Resource:** ⭐⭐⭐ (Moderate resources needed)  
**Timeline:** ⭐⭐⭐ (1-2 weeks)
